I noticed that the heading of the table is showing x x x , so I had to go back to the previous note to fix it

Started the Distribution Exercise.
I noticed that R was not executing my code. I wonder why?

I'm still trying to get R to execute my code. COuld it be from the Laptop which is an older version?
